Set up Pontoon (generic)
========================

To run, Pontoon requires:

- a PostgreSQL database
- a Python web server
- a static files web server
- a way to run sync regularly

This guide goes through installing and setting up those resources on a generic Ubuntu server. They are meant as a guide for people who want to install Pontoon on a platform that does not have a dedicated setup documentation.
